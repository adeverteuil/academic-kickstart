This is so freaking cool I am tripping to the core right now.
Every day in December, the [QEMU Advent Calendar](http://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/2016/)
presents an old school, novel or somehow interesting operating system
that will be automatically downloaded and run in an emulator
by executing the `run.sh` file.
Imma try and upload them to [INAP's OpenStack](http://www.internap.com/cloud/public-cloud/).

Here's FreeGEM (day 6):
