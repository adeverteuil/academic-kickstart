Stockholm, Sweden. A business trip to Grafana Labs.

I concluded my visit in Stockholm with a leasure day.
I did parkour training,
walked around [Gamla Stan](https://www.visitstockholm.com/see--do/attractions/gamla-stan/) taking pictures,
visited the [Nobel Prize museum](https://www.nobelprize.org/about/nobel-museum/),
and had dinner at a colleague's house in Nacka.

Here's my parkour training video!
